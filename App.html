							<p>This project was in response to a frustration I experienced within my university's Student Health system. I decided to try modernise the system to try minimise the pain points that included finding specific clinic rooms, going through the required forms upon arrival, and keeping track of past and present appointments. </p>

<p>After understanding the pain points in the system, the next step was for me to look into the different design opportunities that I could make use of. It became clear early on that an app would solve a lot of the problems that came with figuring things out in the clinic itself. By having the app show an estimated wait time, patients can time their departure time to minimise waiting time and, by extension, unneccessary hassle/restlessness. Including simple call-to-action buttons for the specific map locations of each of the clinics was also something I wanted to include when wireframing.</p>

<p>Over the course of this project, I called upon the Laws of UX a lot to help make the user experience as fluid and simple as possible. Hick's law states that the time it take for a decision increases with the number of choices, this was a factor which I found to be present within my intial negative experience. Using this same principle, except this time in a positive way, I focused on the app's simplicity. By reducing the choices the user has to make and the overall confusion in the UX, we can make it far easier for the user to make easy decisions, therefore leading to a less stressful experience. Jakob's law is also relevant here as it states the user spends the majority of their time on other apps, so they prefer your app to work in the same ways. Simplicity in format and button placement were the main takeaways here.</p>
